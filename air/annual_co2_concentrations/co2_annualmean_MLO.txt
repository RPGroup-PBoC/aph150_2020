# USE OF NOAA ESRL DATA
# 
# These data are made freely available to the public and the
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# ensure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data 
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, 
# ESRL should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.  
# If the ESRL data are essential to the work, or if an important 
# result or conclusion depends on the ESRL data, co-authorship
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
# the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
# ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
# represented.

# RECIPROCITY
# 
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
# of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport
# fields, and additional information necessary for other
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new
# users of the models.

# Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling
# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
#
# The estimated uncertainty in the annual mean is the standard deviation
# of the differences of annual mean values determined independently by
# NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change, 
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
