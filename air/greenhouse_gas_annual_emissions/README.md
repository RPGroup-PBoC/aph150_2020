# Global Carbon Project CO2 Emissions Data

## Description 
Measurements on tons of carbon dioxide by region calculated by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), and carbon dioxide emissions in tons per year broken down by sector from the CAIT Climate Data Explorer. Numbers from the GCP used the 2018 Global Carbon Budgetâ€™s energy statistics, cement production data, deforestation, direct measurement, and global process models to generate their results. CAIT Climate Data Explorer numbers are taken from the Climate Watch Portal.

## Key Numbers
The numbers in these data sets are important to determine anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission trends since the 1750s.
