# Law Dome 2000 Year Ice Core CO2 Data

## Description 
Measurements of CO2 atmospheric concentration found in ice cores and firn air sites. Air is well-preserved in ice cores and is representative of atmospheric CO2 concentrations for the past 2000 years. Specifically, the earliest year the data covers is 154 CE, while the most recent year is 1996 CE. Concentrations are in units of ppm.

## Key Numbers
Any of these numbers may be important depending on the application. For investigating increased ocean acidity since the pre-industrial era, the CO2 ppm from the 19th century (roughly when the Industrial Revolution began) is key.
