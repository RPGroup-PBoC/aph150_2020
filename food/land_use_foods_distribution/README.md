## Notes 
The data is the result of an extensive meta-analysis of food system
impact studies (Poore & Nemecek's 2018: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987)

The authors note the following about the scope of the studies
included in this meta-analysis:
"We derived data from a comprehensive meta-analysis, identifying 1530 studies
for potential inclusion, which were supplemented with additional data received from 139 authors.
Studies were assessed against 11 criteria designed to standardize methodology,
resulting in 570 suitable studies with a median reference year of 2010.
The data set covers ~38,700 commercially viable farms in 119 countries and 40 products
representing ~90% of global protein and calorie consumption'.
