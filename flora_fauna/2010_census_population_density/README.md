# Most Densely Populated Cities in the United States

## Description

This table copied from Wikipedia lists the 31 most densely populated cities in
the United States, as determined by data from the 2010 census. For the purpose
of this table, cities with populations under 75,000 people were excluded, so as
to avoid outliers.

## Key Numbers

There is no single key number for this dataset, but note that the population
density of large, dense US cities ranges between 4,000 and 10,000 people per
square kilometer.

* **Bias**: LEAST BIASED for Wikipedia, and no bias likely in census data

## Notes

The `people per km^2` column is not in descending order with `rank`, while the
`people per mi^2` column is. Manual computation using the `population` and `land
area (mi^2)` columns determined that the `people per km^2` column is accurate,
while the `people per mi^2` and `rank` columns are not. The `people per km^2`
column should be used for any further computations.
