# Extinction Number 

## Description 

Compilation of data involved in the calculation of extinction numbers for different groups. Extinction rates are expressed as modern normalized extinction rates, extinction numbers (modern/background), and modern extinction rates in species per year. Modern extinction data comes from the IUCN, background extinction rate for animals estimate comes from *Extinction Rates* by R. Lawton, background extinction rate for vertebrates comes from Barnosky et al (2011), background extinction rate for plants comes from Vellend et al (2017), total number of animal/plant species from Mora et al (2011), total mammal species from Burgin et al (2018), and total avian species from Barrowclough et al 2016)
## Key Numbers
The key numbers are the extinction numbers for animals (260) and plants (99).

## Source Information
Fill out the table below for each data set. 

* **Source Website**: IUCN Red List
* **URL**: iucnredlist.org
* **Bias**:  `NOT ANNOTATED`

## Notes 
Raw data from the IUCN Red List can be easily obtained by going to the URL above and applying to look at the data, however the raw data obtained this way (which is what I used) cannot be reproduced or disseminated under the license I was given, so the data shown here is not the raw data but is the processed data that had been sorted and analyzed. Modern extinction rate was calculated as the number of extinctions divided by the total species assessed in the IUCN divided by 400 years (the approximate range of extinctions represented by the list) expressed as extinctions per million species per year. Extinction rate as extinctions per year was calculated by multiplying the extinction rate per species per year by the number of extant species in the taxon.
