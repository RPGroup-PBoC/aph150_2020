## Notes 

The majority of this data was collected from FAO questionnaires (self-reported),
with some information reported from country official publications or websites.
After an order of magnitude reasonability estimate on the amount of 
agricultural land required to sustain the human population, this data
was determined to be "reasonable". (The estimate was 30 million km2, which
is consistent with the 51 million km2 reported area).
