Bias: NOT ANNOTATED for both

Notes: Market research firms have no incentive to deceive, so the revenue number is likely accurate. While K-TEC may have an ulterior motive to overstate the amount of earth they moved, it's an easily verifiable number by industry experts and thus is unlikely to be significantly off.
