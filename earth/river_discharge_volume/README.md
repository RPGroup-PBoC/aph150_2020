# River Discharge Volume

## Description
This table includes data on the discharge volume of the world's most sizeable rivers by this metric. Information is provided on the discharge both at the lowest available measuring station for each river and on the discharge at the mouth. Standard deviations are provided for the former. Drainage basin area is also provided.

## Key numbers
The most significant numbers in the paper from which this data set was drawn for the purpose of my estimate are the discharge volume of the Amazon at its mouth (6642 km^3/yr) as well as another that is in the introduction: the total river discharge to the oceans is about 37288 \pm 662 km^3/yr.

## Notes
The three rivers with the largest discharges (the Amazon, Congo, and Orinoco - indeed, the only rivers with annual discharges greater than 1000 km^3) all flow through dense rainforests for most of their lengths, meaning that the sediment load they carry due to erosion is likely similar.
