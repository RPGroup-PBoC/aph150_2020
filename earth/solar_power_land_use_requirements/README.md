# Solar Power Land Use Requirements

## Description 
This data set contains data on the relationship between land area and power output in solar power plants in the United States. This particular file contains data for flat-panel photovoltaic power plants of the fixed, 1-axis tilt, 2-axis tilt, and concentrated variety, but not for concentrated solar thermal power plants.

## Key Numbers
From the data in the table, it can be calculated that on average, the power density of the solar power plants is 7.82E8 Joules per year per square meter of solar panels.

## Notes 
The first column represents the type of solar panel. PV refers to photovoltaic.

In the second column, small size is defined as <20 MW, and large size >20 MW.

In the fourth column, the land use requirements are in acres of direct land use, meaning the land that is zoned for solar panels. This includes the space between the solar panels.

In the fifth column, the average packing factor refers to the fraction of the direct land use that is actually occupied by solar panels. 

In the sixth column, the power density has been calculated using the data in the other columns. This data was not provided directly by NREL.
