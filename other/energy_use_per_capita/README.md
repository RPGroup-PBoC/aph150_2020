## Description

This dataset shows primary energy consumption of the world per capita from 1960-2015 for countries with available data. Primary energy refers to usage of raw energy forms (e.g. oil, coal, renewables) before transformation into end-use forms (electricity, etc.). Data is recorded in kWh.


## Key Numbers
In 1971, world energy usage per capita was 15,540 kWh. In 2014, world usage per capita was 22,336 kWh, revealing an increase by 43.7%.

## Notes
This dataset was published in the World Bank's WDI report. The report compiles energy data from the International Energy Agency. Population estimates are compiled through World Bank data, leading to per capita data points. Energy data is subject to use through the IEA terms and conditions.

In this dataset, all energy is converted to oil equivalents, with a thermal efficiency of 33% when converting nuclear and 100% when converting hyroelectric power. Each country's estimate includes energy imports and excludes exports. Political changes account for some gaps in time series data.

The dataset uses a weighted average when computed values on the world scale. According to one of the footnotes, data for renewables and waste for some countries is from small scale surveys, and "not strictly comparable across countries". The data is more accurate when taken as a whole.
