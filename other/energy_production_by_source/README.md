# World Primary Energy Production by Source, Country, and Year

## Description

This table shows the primary energy production in the world from coal, oil, natural gas, wind, hydro, solar, nuclear, other renewables. Primary energy is defined as energy that has not been subjected to any human engineered conversion process. The type of production involved is not specificed but may include electricity production, transportation, etc.

## Key Numbers
While the data set is quite large, one important number that can be found in this dataset is the amount of primary energy produced worldwide in 2018 (latest available year), which is 145,642 terawatt-hours = 524 exajoules.

## Notes 
From a human impacts perspective, primary energy production is an important quantity, perhaps more so than consumption, because it represents the resources used by humans, regardless of the inefficiencies of refinement or conversion for everyday use.

The data was compiled by Our World in Data, drawing from several data tables researched by BP and published in their Statistical Review of World Energy. Below are the names of the source tables and details:

* **Renewable energy generation** (includes wind, solar, and "other renewables" category): Based on gross generation and not accounting for cross–border electricity supply. "Other renewables" refers to electricity generated from: geothermal, biomass, and other sources of renewable energy (not already itemized).
* **Coal production:** Commercial solid fuels only, i.e. bituminous coal and anthracite (hard coal), lignite and brown (sub-bituminous) coal, and other commercial solid fuels. Includes coal produced for coal-to-liquidsandcoal-to-gastransformations.
* **Oil production:** Includes crude oil, shale oil, oil sands, condensates (both lease condensate and gas plant condensate) and NGLs (natural gas liquids – ethane, LPG and naphtha separated from the productionof natural gas). Excludes liquid fuels from other sources such as biomass and derivatives of coal and natural gas.
*  **Natural gas production:** Excludes gas flared or recycled. Includes natural gas produced for gas-to-liquids transformation.
* **Nuclear generation:** No additional information found.
