# Energy Consumption by Sector

## Description 

Worldwide energy consumption from 2010 and estimations until 2050 tabulated by end-use sector (industrial, commercial, residential, and transportation) and the primary energy consumption (liquids, natural gas, coal, renewables) and electricity consumption for that sector. The data makes another distinction for electricity, and shows the primary energy sources used to generate electricity, including energy wasted in the generation process.

## Key Numbers
In 2014 (used in presentation and vignette because this was the latest year available for a different, comparison dataset), the worldwide energy consumption was 582.734 quadrillion Btu.

## Notes 
In this dataset, the total energy consumption was calculated based on primary source energy consumption, including liquids, natural gas, coal, renewables, and additionally in the case of electricity generation, nuclear energy. The data is split into the following categories:

**Residential Sector** : Energy consumption from all primary energy sources (liquids, natural gas, coal, renewables) and electricity used in residential sector, and total (sum of all primary energy sources).

**Commericial Sector**: Energy consumption from all primary energy sources (liquids, natural gas, coal, renewables) and electricity used in commercial sector, and total (sum of all primary energy sources).

**Industrial Sector**: Energy consumption from all primary energy sources (liquids, natural gas, coal, renewables) and electricity used in industrial sector, and total (sum of all primary energy sources).

**Residential Sector**: Energy consumption from all primary energy sources (liquids, natural gas, coal, renewables) and electricity used in residential sector, and total (sum of all primary energy sources).

**All End-use Sector**: Total of primary energy consumption for each sector + electricty from previous categories + "wasted" primary energy consumed in electricity generation.

**Electric-Power Sector**: Energy consumption from all primary energy sources (liquids, natural gas, coal, nuclear, renewables) for electricity generation. This data includes the wasted primary energy consumed in electricity generation, due to 33% efficiency in power plants for electricity generation. This is equal to the sum of "electricty from previous categories" + ""wasted" primary energy consumed in electricity generation" from the end-use sector.

**Total Energy Consumption**: Total of primary energy consumption for each sector and electricity generation.
