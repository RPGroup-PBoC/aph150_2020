# Carnot Number
###### APh150 analysis done by Alexander Bouman

For our purposes, the Carnot number is defined as follows:

### Analysis

```Presentaion.nb``` is a Mathematica which outlines the impact of the Carnot number, how we can approximate it, and computes the empirical value of the Carnot number across [Grand Coulee Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Coulee_Dam). A PDF rendering of this notebook is found in ```Presentaion.pdf```.

### Data

The raw data in ```carnot_number/data/raw_river_temperatures``` was collected by the University of Washington's School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences and can be found [here](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart). This data was tidied and put in the ```carnot_number/tidied_river_temperatures``` directory.

### Graphics

The ```carnot_number/graphics``` directory contains graphics generated by and used in the analysis notebook.
