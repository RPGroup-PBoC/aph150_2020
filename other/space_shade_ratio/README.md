# Orbital Debris ESD Experimental Data 

## Description 

orbital-debris-data-tidy.xlsx contains both the raw and processed data taken from the source given below. Using DigitizeIt, we determined the conversion information shown in columns K, L, and M. These conversion factors were then combined with the experimental data from the source below to estimate the sample number of objects with a particular equivalent sphere diameter as a histogram data set. 

## Key Numbers

There is not necessarily a key number in this data set, but the data can be used to calculate an estimate for the space shade ratio (also called the satellite shade ratio), which is a key number.

## Source Information
Fill out the table below for each data set.
