# Garbage in Earth's Oceans

## Description

The Plastic Marine Pollution datasets and its Our World in Data derivatives
are based on expeditions from 2007 - 2013.  They survey all major ocean
gyre systems (North Pacific, North Atlantic, South Pacific, South Atlantic,
Indian Ocean), as well as extensive coastal regions and enclosed seas (Bay 
of Bengal, Aus-tralian coasts and the Mediterranean Sea).  These 
expeditions use a combination of surface net tows and  visual survey 
transects for large plastic debris to sample how much trash is in the 
ocean.  These surveyers then sort the plastics they find into certain 
sizes, roughly dividing into macroplastics and microplastics, before 
determining the weight of the plastics for each size group.  The 
Microplastic Numerical and Mass Concentration dataset was calculated in a 
similar manner by using plankton net tows to collect microplastic debris, 
however only sampled over the two pacific gyres (Northern and Southern
Pacific).

However for both datasets, there is bias towards sampling the 
Northern Pacific gyre. Looking at the geolocations recorded from 
each sampling location illustrates the bias towards sampling the
Northern Pacific gyre, for both datasets.
